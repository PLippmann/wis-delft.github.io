                    <p> After the increased adoption of machine learning (ML) in various applications and disciplines,
                        a synergy between the database (DB) systems and ML communities emerged. Steps involved in ML pipelines,
                        such as data preparation and cleaning, feature engineering, and management of the ML lifecycle can benefit
                        from research conducted by the data management community. For example, the management of the ML lifecycle
                        requires mechanisms for modeling, storing, and querying ML artifacts. Moreover, in many use cases pipelines
                        require a mixture of relational and linear algebra operators, raising the question of whether a seamless
                        integration between the two algebras is possible. 
                    </p>
                    <p> In the opposite direction, ML techniques are explored in core components of database systems, e.g.,
                        query optimization, indexing, and monitoring. Traditionally hard problems in databases, such as
                        cardinality estimation, or problems with high human supervision like DB administration, might benefit
                        more from learning algorithms than from rule-based or cost-based approaches.
                    </p>
                    <p> The workshop aims at bringing together re-searchers and practitioners in the intersection of
                        DB and ML research, providing a forum for DB-inspired or ML-inspired approaches addressing
                        challenges encountered in each of the two areas. In particular, we welcome new research topics
                        combining the strengths of both fields.
